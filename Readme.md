Well, it is nothing new about TV industry. This is a set of digital television API that fully describes 
nearly all the aspects of so-called DTV services: <br>
* DVB (Digital Video Broadcast)
* Cable TV
* Satellite TV
* Terrestrial TV
* IPTV (through Wifi or Ethernet)
* HbbTV (Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV)
* EPG (Electronic Program Guide)
* PVR/DVR (Personal Video Recorder)
* Timeshift TV
* VOD (Video On Demand)
* Teletext
* Booking-Program service
and more.. <br>

Since it is called High Level API, this is defined from the user's or UI's point of view. <br>
There are nearly no meaningful comments and explainations for the API, because these APIs are self-explained. We tried to implement them on several different platforms based on different software architectures. Believe me, it is clear and easy for the guys in this industry.
